          This is part of my graduation project back at TU Delft. The aim of the project was to test weather designers could learn to code an interactive room fitted with a newtowrk sensors. This project was a collaborative effort between me and a team of engineers from the Computer Science faculty.

      <p>
        This project was the combination of two different efforts.
        On one side you had the engineers, who wanted to build a distributed network of microcontrollers inside an interactive room.
        <br>On the other side, you have me, a designer whose job was to simplify the complexity around coding for distributed networks, to allow designers to create interactive pieces inside the interactive room.
        The main challenges for this project were:

            Distributed networks don't rely on the programming paradigm we are most familiar with.
            Object Oriented Programming was not an option for us since our distributed network was built on a different paradigm, called State Machine.

            State Machine is a very unfamiliar paradigm.
            For me, the main challenge was to figure out how much effort users were willing to put into learning the paradigm, and still get something useful out of it, once they used it.

        <h1>Asking people to create state machines for common devices</h1>
        <p>
          One of the first step for me was to create a series of experiments, aimed at understanding if people could grasp how State Machines work.
          I run these experiments with volounteers, picked at random from around the faculty.

          The test setup
        </h2>
        <p>
          Each participants was asked to replicate the behaviors of everyday machines, like a vending machine or a microwave.
          To do that they were given 3 predefined states, plus a list of input, output and actions. By combining those together they had to fill in the gaps and create as many states as they needed to perform a task (in the case of the vending machine, take some money and give out food).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <h2>Key learning</h2>
        <p>
          The main learning for this experiments was that State Machines don't allow for much flexibility.
          As long as the behaviour intended is quite linear (if this then that) then people can manage.
          But as soon as more responsiveness is introduced keeping track of all the states changes becomes rather difficult.

      <h1>Taking</h1>
      <p>
        The second rounds of experiments was taking the abstraction one step further. The new set of rules were introducing random ranges of values based on the interaction between friends and posts.
        <br>So, for example, the more activity a post would get, the thicker the lines would become.
        Or if the post happened at certain times of the day, then the slant of the line would increase or decrease accordingly, and so forth.

        All this seemingly random rules where used as a procedural way to create unexpected visual patterns, regardless of the relationship between data points (much like with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_LeWitt">Sol LeWiit</a> art, minus the talent).
