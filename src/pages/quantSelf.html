        What fascinated me about <a href="http://mariuswatz.com">Marius Watz's</a> art is the possibility of painting with code. His ability to generate stunning visuals based on seemingly random rules and numbers is just mindblowing. After being introduced to his work I started thinking about my own experiments. I decided I was not interested in telling a "story" with my data, trying to uncover some magical unseen detail of my digital self. Instead I wanted to see how the data I gathered about me could be used as my own digital brush.

            I decided to use Facebook as a data source which gave me access to large sets of data that could be as flexible as I needed them to be.

          <h1>2</h1>
          <p>
            The second step was to take the data apart. More than looking for emergent patterns I started looking how this data sets interacted together.

        Learning to become a Processing ninja
      </h1>
      <p>
        For these experiments I used Processing. I was already familiar with the tool, and although you could pick your weapon of choice for this, Marius Wats is a master I wanted to learn from.
        Plus, Processing has an amazing community of users creating libraries for almost anything, which meant I could focus on experimenting and not bang my head trying to solve technical challenges.

      <h1>Playing with patterns in my data</h1>
      <p>
        What fascinated me about <a href="http://mariuswatz.com">Marius Watz's</a> process is the idea of painting with code. His ability to abstract numbers and variables into visual pattern is just mindblowing.
        When it came to choose a process for my experiments, I decided to not focus on story telling through data. Instead I decided to see how the patterns in my data could become digital brush strokes for my work.

        The image on the right is based on two identical sets of data from my girlfriend's and my Facebook accounts.
        The thicher green and yellow lines in the middle are the data points representing the number of posts made over the previous 6 months.
        Each of the post is then connected to the red arches representing the group of friends that interacted most with us in that same period.

      <h1>Randomising the rules</h1>
      <p>
        The second rounds of experiments was taking the abstraction one step further. The new set of rules were introducing random ranges of values based on the interaction between friends and posts. So, for example, the more activity a post would get the thicker the lines.
        Except the value for thickness was not decided by me, rather from the amount of activity of said user.
        Or if the post happened at certain times of the day, then the slant of the line would increase or decrease accordingly.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="columns small-12 medium-expand quantSelf large-6">
      <p>
        Again, the rules where used as precedural way to create visual patterns, regardless of relationship between data point (much like with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_LeWitt">Sol LeWiit</a> art, minus the talent).

          <p>
            Retention is all about making sure the customer keeps on engaging with your service regularly. Wether the user comes back or not be there for them.<br><br>A retention strategy changes drastically depending on the service offered. In our case it turned out to be a personal message suggesting they check out a feature they didn’t activate or reminding them that ABNK doesn’t charge fees on exchange.
