        What fascinated me about <a href="#">Marius Watz's</a> art is the possibility of painting with code. His ability to generate stunning visuals based on seemingly random rules and numbers is just mindblowing. After being introduced to his work I started thinking about my own experiments. I decided I was not interested in telling a "story" with my data, trying to uncover some magical unseen detail of my digital self. Instead I wanted to see how the data I gathered about me could be used as my own digital brush.

        The process I followed was rather simple.

            I decided to use Facebook as a data source which gave me access to large sets of data that could be as flexible as I needed them to be.

          <h1>2</h1>
          <p>
            The second step was to take the data apart. More than looking for emergent patterns I started looking how this data sets interacted together.

            Start creating rules based on those interaction I thought were interesting. This is where the magic happens :)

        Learning to become a Processing ninja
      </h1>
      <p>
        For these experiments I used Processing. I was already familiar with the tool, and although you could pick your weapon of choice for this, Marius Wats is a master. On the plus side Processing has an amazing community of artist sharing their work and creating libraries for almost anything, which meant I could focus on experimenting and not bang my head trying to solve technical challenges.

      <h1>Playing with patterns in my data</h1>
      <p>
        What fascinated me about <a href="#">Marius Watz's</a> process is the idea of painting with code. His ability to abstract numbers and variables into visual pattern was just mindblowing. As for me, I was not interested in story telling through data. Instead I wanted to see how patterns in my data could become digital brush strokes for my work.

      <h1>Step 2: Activate</h1>
      <p>
        Next is activating your customer and the best way to do that is by going through the two stages of enticing and onboarding them.

      <div class="row align-middle">
        <div class="columns small-12 medium-expand">
          <h2>Give them something along the way</h2>
          <p>
            A good activation practice is to <strong>give something valuable to the customer </strong>as they go by your signup process. If you are an e-commerce site, give them a free discount and if you’re ABNK give them a way to spend money asap. <br> Doing so will give them a reason to use the app straightway.<br> It’s a win win.
          </p>
          <h2>Fast track them to the real product</h2>
          <p>
            No one likes filling forms, especially so on mobile. With ABNK we designed the signup to be the fastest signup possible in order to have the user in the app fast.

          <p>
            Retention is all about making sure the customer keeps on engaging with your service regularly. Wether the user comes back or not be there for them.<br><br>A retention strategy changes drastically depending on the service offered. In our case it turned out to be a personal message suggesting they check out a feature they didn’t activate or reminding them that ABNK doesn’t charge fees on exchange.
